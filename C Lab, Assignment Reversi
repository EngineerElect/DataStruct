C Lab, Assignment: Reversi
BEFORE starting the assignments.
The deadline for the assigment is shown on the Surreylearn submission system.
For this assignment, you will be asked to implement the board game Reversi (otherwise known as Othello).
You will be provided with the source code for the main function and the requirements of the lower level
functions needed to run the game.
When submitting the files, you MUST follow the name specification as described in the end of each part of
the assignment. Failing to follow the name specification will result in a penalty of 10 percent reduction
from your final mark.
Playing the Game
Reversi is a two player game (black and white), and is normally played on an 8x8 grid. The object of the
game is to fill the board with your own colour of pieces. You win if at the end of the game there are more
pieces of your own colour on the board than your opponent’s. The initial setup of the board is two pieces
from each player, placed diagonally to each other in the centre of the board, as shown in Figure 1.
Each player in turn places a piece on the board, starting with the player using the white pieces. A valid
move is one where you can turn at least one of your opponents pieces into a piece of your colour. You can
do this if when you place your piece on the board, it terminates a continuous line of pieces of the opposing
colour, with one of your pieces at the other end of the line. All of the pieces in the line are then flipped to
your colour. The lines can be in any of the eight lateral and diagonal directions from the position you have
chosen. If there is more than one such line of pieces, all of them are flipped to your colour. For example,
take figure 2 to be the current status of play, it is white to move. White can make a move at (x,y) position
(4,7). This will flip the black pieces situated in (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) and (4,6) to white, thus leaving the black
player with only two pieces left on the board.
Basic Rules of the boardgame
1. The player with the white pieces goes first, and then play alternates.
2. To make a move, you must be able to flip at least one of your opponents pieces to your colour, by
completing a line of pieces as described above.
3. If you can make a valid move, you must (NOTE: this is a rule of the boardgame, but it does not need
to be implemented for this assignment).
4. If you can’t go, you must pass your turn and your opponent plays again.
Starting the Assignment
Firstly, cd to your eeclabs directory. Then download the input files for part 1 to this directory from
SurreyLearn.
This should include the header file reversi.h, the C source files reversi.c, reversi1.c, reversi2.c and
reversi3.c, and the sample input/output files revi1, revo1 and revo2. T

Figure 2: Illustration of a typical move in the game. Blue circle shows the new (white) token played, and
the grayed out tokens indicate the black tokens flipped to white by this move.
3
Together the four C files and the header file make up a single multi-file C program, i.e. a program generated
from multiple source files, but with only one main() function. Compile the program with the command
gcc -ansi -Wall reversi.c reversi1.c reversi2.c reversi3.c -o reversi
It should compile successfully. Run it using the command:
./reversi
You will find that the program only parses the command line options and exits.
Command Line Arguments
The command line is where you enter your commands when initialising a program. This game requires
the size of the board and the nature of play to be entered when running the program. If neither of these
parameters are entered, default values are assumed.
The syntax of a general call to run the reversi program is
./reversi -size <size_of_board> -users <nature_of_play>
The default size of the board is 8 × 8, and the default user is human against human (hh). The size of the
board must be an even number, and the users can be varied over hh, hc, ch and cc (human vs. human,
human vs. computer etc.). So for instance
./reversi -size 12
sets the board size to 12 but leaves the users as the default human vs. human, while
./reversi -size 12 -users ch
also sets the users to computer (white) vs. human (black). The code to deal with these command line
options is already written for you.
Your assignment is to build this program into a working Reversi game by filling in the empty functions.
Externally defined variables
In the header file reversi.h there are extern declarations. These correspond to global variables defined
in reversi.c. extern variable declarations are used when you want to use a global variable defined in a
different source file. An extern declaration basically says “there is a variable of this type and name defined
somewhere else in the program, so I can use it here”. In this case the extern declarations allow the files
reversi1.c, reversi2.c and reversi3.c to use the global variables defined in reversi.c.
Part 1: Initialise and Print Board (35 marks)
In the first part of the assignment, you are to fill in the functions Initialise Board() and Print Board()
by modifying reversi1.c. Initialise Board() should set the board positions to zero values (use the
defined constant EMPTY SPACE), and place the starting four pieces on t
4
score for both players (two pieces each). Use the defined constants PLAYER1 and PLAYER2 to indicate the
white/black pieces respectively. Both functions need to read the size global variable to determine the size
of the board. The maximum board size is 16. When these functions are implemented, and the program
recompiled as above, the program should print the initial board configuration and exit. The format in which
the board should be printed to standard output is as follows, for a 12 × 12 board:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
1: . . . . . . . . . . . .
2: . . . . . . . . . . . .
3: . . . . . . . . . . . .
4: . . . . . . . . . . . .
5: . . . . . . . . . . . .
6: . . . . . * O . . . . .
7: . . . . . O * . . . . .

9: . . . . . . . . . . . .
10: . . . . . . . . . . . .
11: . . . . . . . . . . . .
12: . . . . . . . . . . . .
Player 1 (O) score: 2
Player 2 (*) score: 2
If the state of play was such as Figure 2, the following would be printed to standard output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
1: . . O . . . . .
2: . . . O . . . .
3: . . O * O . . .
4: . . . * * * . .
5: . . O * O . . .
6: . . . * . . . .
7: . . . . . . . .
8: . . . . . . . .
Player 1 (O) score: 6
Player 2 (*) score: 6
Two characters are used for each board position indicator 1...12. A line of underline characters (’ ’) separates
the x-position numbers from the board itself. An ’O’ is printed for a white piece, ’*’ for a black piece, and
’.’ for an empty square.
Note: The marker for a white piece is a capital letter O, not the number zero (0).
A colon (’:’) separates the y-position indicators from the board. A newline character should be printed at
the start to leave a space above the printed board. The current scores for each player (number of pieces on
the board of the relevant colour) should be printed as above.
Please note that, as with the other assignments, the testing that will be applied to your program involves
comparing what your program prints to standard output (stdout) with the correct output specified in
the assignment sheet and produced by our reference program. Your program must conform to the specified
5
output format to be classified as a working program. Therefore please take note of any instructions regarding
output. The use of the standard error (stderr) is however unrestricted, so any debugging messages, prompts
etc. should be fprintf’d to stderr.
Compile the program with the command
gcc -ansi -Wall reversi.c reversi1.c reversi2.c reversi3.c -o reversi
The program should print the starting position as above and exit.
When you have thoroughly debugged and tested your program (reversi1.c), and have written the comment
blocks into the source code as described in the rules for assignments on the Web page, re-name your file
according to the following specification and then submit the program to SurreyLearn.
NOTE 1: The name of the submitted file MUST be proceeded with your surname and initial followed by
the name of the program. For example, if your surname is “Brown”, and your first name is “Peter”, you
need to name the file as follows:
BROWNP-reversi1.c
The first part is your surname and initial followed by a hyphen, and then followed by the original filename.
If you also have middle names, ignore them in the file name. If your files do not follow this name
specification, as a penalty, 10 percent will be deducted from your final mark.
NOTE 2: Submit your program (named according to NOTE 1) to SurreyLearn, which can be accessed via
the following web site:
http://surreylearn.surrey.ac.uk/
Please use your university username and password (the same username and password that you use to access
your university email and computers in the campus) to login. Once you login to SurreyLearn, you will be able
to see the links to COMPUTERS & PROGRAMMING 1: THE C LANGUAGE on your My SurreyLearn Homepage.
Click this link, and submit your assignment to the folder Assignment - Reversi.
Part 2: Reversi for Two Human Players (50 marks)
In part 2 of the assignment you should implement the functions required to allow you to play Reversi between
two human players. The functions in reversi2.c are Get Human Move(), Get Score() and Move(), which
are explained in the source template provided to you. In Get Human Move, you need to request the x and
y positions for a move as a single string on a line, so that if the player types “4 7” and presses return, the
move is on the position x=4, y=7. Assume that the x-axis is horizontal and the y-axis is vertical. Remember
that in your C code you will use x/y coordinates starting from zero, so you will need to subtract one from
the values typed in at the keyboard. The function Get Human Move() should also handle reading “p” or
“q” from the keyboard instead of x/y values. If the player types “p” it means pass, and the other player
moves. In this case Get Human Move() should return zero. If “q” is typed, you should return the value -1
from Get Human Move(), and the program terminates. The program is organised so that only the keyboard
x & y coordinates (or “p”/“q”) are read from the input, and only the board positions and scores are printed
to standard output (by Print Board()). This makes it easy to run a gam
6
you should get the output given by the file revo1.
Compile the program with the command
gcc -ansi -Wall reversi.c reversi1.c reversi2.c reversi3.c -o reversi
When you have thoroughly debugged and tested your program (reversi2.c), and have written the comment
blocks into the source code as described in the rules for assignments on the Web page, re-name your file
according to the following specification and then submit the program to both SurreyLearn.
NOTE 1: The name of the submitted file MUST be proceeded with your surname and initial followed by
the name of the program. For example, if your surname is “Brown”, and your first name is “Peter”, you
need to name the file as follows:
BROWNP-reversi2.c
The first part is your surname and initial followed by a hyphen, and then followed by the original filename.
If you also have middle names, ignore them in the file name. If your files do not follow this name
specification, as a penalty, 10 percent will be deducted from your final mark.
Part 3: Reversi with One/Two Computer Players (15 marks)
In the final part of the assignment you write the function Best Move in the file reversi3.c which implements
a simple algorithm to find a “best” move. The algorithm checks every possible move, and finds the move
which flips most pieces to black/white. If there is more than one “best” move, choose the move closest to
the top-left corner of the board in “raster-scan” order. In other words, choose move 2 2 over 3 2 and also
over 3 3 or 1 3. The Best Move() function should implement this algorithm and return the score for the
move (number of pieces flipped plus one for the new move).
When the Best Move() function is written, you can compile it with the usual command
gcc -ansi -Wall reversi.c reversi1.c reversi2.c reversi3.c -o reversi
and test it by playing computer against computer:
./reversi -users cc > tmp
The output file can be compared with the correct output file revo2.
When you have thoroughly debugged and tested your program (reversi3.c), and have written the comment
blocks into the source code as described in the rules for assignments on the Web page, re-name your file
according to the following specification and then submit the program to both SurreyLearn.
NOTE 1: The name of the submitted file MUST be proceeded with your surname and initial followed by
the name of the program. For example, if your surname is “Brown”, and your first name is “Peter”, you
need to name the file as follows:
BROWNP-reversi3.c
The first part is your surname and initial followed by a hyphen, and then followed by the original filename.
If you also have middle names, ignore them in the file name. If your files do not follow this name
specification, as a penalty, 10 percent will be deducted from your final mark.
